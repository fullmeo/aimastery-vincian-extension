## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **DI Container** instead of Singletons
   - Why: Testability, flexibility
   - Impact: Week 1 task

2. **AST-based Analysis** (TypeScript Compiler API)
   - Why: Accuracy, rich metadata
   - Alternative considered: Regex (rejected - too brittle)

3. **Weighted Composite Scoring**
   - Why: Flexibility to emphasize important principles
   - Default weights: Simplicity (1.25), Movement (1.2), Unity (1.15)

4. **Real-time Monitoring** with caching
   - Why: Fast user feedback
   - Tradeoff: Memory usage (mitigated by LRU cache)

5. **12 Commandments** (not 10, not 15)
   - Why: Comprehensive but not overwhelming
   - Based on: SOLID, Clean Code, industry best practices

---

### Product Decisions

1. **MVP: TypeScript/JavaScript only**
   - Why: 70% of our users, fastest to market
   - Python/Java in v8.1

2. **Free tier with premium upsell**
   - Why: Lower barrier to entry, monetization path
   - Target: 10% conversion

3. **Focus on quality, not speed**
   - Why: Differentiate from Kilocode/Copilot
   - Positioning: Complementary tool

4. **10-week timeline**
   - Why: Ambitious but achievable
   - Buffer: Can cut 3 commandments if needed

5. **Beta launch at Week 10**
   - Why: Get feedback before public launch
   - Target: 100 beta testers
