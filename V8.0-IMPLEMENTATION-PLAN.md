## 💡 Final Notes

### Why This Plan Will Work

1. **Focused Scope**: MVP only, no feature creep
2. **Realistic Timeline**: 10 weeks with buffer
3. **Clear Milestones**: Weekly checkpoints
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks upfront
5. **Unique Value**: Differentiated from competition

### What Could Go Wrong

1. **Underestimated Complexity**: Some algorithms (LCOM4) may be harder than expected
   - **Solution**: Simplify or use existing libraries
2. **Performance Issues**: Analysis could be too slow
   - **Solution**: Aggressive caching, Web Workers
3. **Low User Interest**: Maybe developers don't care about code beauty
   - **Solution**: Pre-launch validation, beta program

### Contingency Plans

- **If 2 weeks behind by Week 5**: Cut 3 commandments, defer to v8.1
- **If 1 week behind by Week 8**: Skip video tutorials, launch with docs only
- **If critical bug in Week 10**: Delay launch by 1 week, fix properly
